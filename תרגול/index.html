<h1>Welcome 2 Cukur Street</h1>
<h2>What is Cukur?</h2>
<p class="title">
Çukur, one of the most dangerous neighborhoods of Istanbul, is ruled by the Koçova family. Although they are closely related to crime, the family has its own rules. One of these rules is the prohibition of drugs. Drugs cannot be produced, used or sold in Çukur. But one of the upstarts is determined to break the ban. First he tries to negotiate with the Koçova's but when his request is rejected he attacks the neighborhood and the family with his power. Just as he thinks that he has put the family on their knees something unpredicted comes up. Now the cards need to be dealt again. Yamaç is a young man who has focused himself on living life the way he wants to. He's a man who doesn't think about tomorrow. One night he meets a beautiful young woman as wounded and dangerous as himself. Her name is Sena. Soon they fall in love and get married. While thinking that they would live "happily ever after", Yamaç's family that he believed he had left behind comes between them. As Sena follows Yamaç and runs in the family, they are not aware that their lives will never be the same.<br>
